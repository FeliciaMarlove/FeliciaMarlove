- 👋 Hi, I’m @FeliciaMarlove, I'm a 30-something Software Engineer based in Belgium. I'm pretty good at Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and I know a bit about Microsoft Azure
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering, User experience, Developer experience, CI/CD, DevOps, Cloud, career growth, team collaboration
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Koltin, Python, Docker, Kubernetes (and many more things!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on concrete projects (I have tons of ideas but I would work on someone else's project too) and writing projects (books, blogs, guides...)
- 📫 How to reach me on Twitter [@Code_She_Writes](https://twitter.com/code_she_writes), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florence-mary-87397530/) and via my [Blog](https://thecodeshewrites.com/)
